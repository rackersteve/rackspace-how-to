Rackspace occasionally performs maintenance to increase the stability
and performance of the Cloud Block Storage platform. This article provides
some tips for minimizing the impact of this maintenance on your environment.

###  How can I reduce the impact of the maintenance?

You can either clone and replace your Cloud Block Storage volume, or stop all writes to the device until the maintenance is complete.

#### Clone and replace

After you [clone your Cloud Block Storage volume](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/create-a-clone-of-a-cloud-block-storage-volume/), the resulting clone should land on an unaffected host server.

**Non-system disk Cloud Block Storage volumes:**

- Stop all writes to your current Cloud Block Storage volume before initiating the clone. Once all writes to the current Cloud Block Storage volume have been stopped, clone the volume. Once the clone completes, [unmount and detach](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/detach-and-delete-cloud-block-storage-volumes/) the current Cloud Block Storage volume. Then [attach the new volume](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/create-and-attach-a-cloud-block-storage-volume/) (the clone).

**Note:** Clones are not verified. Ensure the newly-cloned volume is working before deleting your current Cloud Block Storage volume.

**System disk Cloud Block Storage volumes (Boot from volume servers):**

- [Replace your current system disk with a clone.](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/increase-size-of-cloud-boot-from-volume-server-system-disk/)

**Note:** Clones are not verified. Ensure the newly-cloned volume is working before deleting your current Cloud Block Storage volume.

#### Stop all writes to the device

**Non-system disk Cloud Block Storage volumes:**

- [Unmount and detach](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/detach-and-delete-cloud-block-storage-volumes/) any Cloud Block Storage volume impacted by the maintenance. (The link includes instructions to delete Cloud Block Storage volumes&mdash;you should only complete the unmount and detach sections.)

**System disk Cloud Block Storage volumes (Boot from volume servers):**

- To avoid writes to the system disk, you must shut down your cloud server from the operating system (OS) at least 10 minutes before the maintenance starts. This causes your server to show as "Shutoff"  in the mycloud portal. After you receive a ticket confirming that the maintenance is complete, reboot the server from the mycloud portal by selecting **Actions**> **Reboot**. Your server boots up and displays as "Active" in the mycloud portal.

#### If your disk goes into read-only mode

**Non-system disk Cloud Block Storage volumes:**

- If your volume is in read-only mode, unmount the volume, run a filesystem check
(Linux&reg; with 'ext3/4' or fsck, Windows&reg; with 'chkdsk'), and then remount the volume as described above.
If the disk is still in read-only mode after a filesystem check, try a reboot to correct the problem. If that
does not work, contact Rackspace Support.

**System disk Cloud Bloud Storage volumes (Boot from volume servers):**

- Reboot the server. If the server is unresponsive or does not reboot, you can [boot
into rescue mode by using a specific image](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-servers/v2/api-reference/svr-basic-operations/#rescue-specified-server).

**Note:** This feature is not yet available from the myrackspace.com portal, so you must use the API.

When the server is in rescue mode, follow the directions listed above for non-system disk Cloud Block Storage  volumes. Contact Rackspace Support for additional assistance.
